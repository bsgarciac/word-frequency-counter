# Word Frecuency Counter

## Technologies
- Framework VueJS 3
- Boostrap 4 for design
- D3 to generate graphs

## Computational Complexity
- The algorithm to count the frecuency of each word in the text is linear O(n), being n the number of words in the text, because it splits the string by spaces and then iterates one time over each word.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run Project
```
npm run serve
```
